# dotfiles

A collection of my dotfiles and configuration which I use in my personal development experience. This repo is meant to be used to quickly get my dev environment setup and running on a new macOS machine.

## Installation

Run this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jwyce/.dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install.sh
```
