Please perform a comprehensive analysis of this code repository and create detailed documentation written to REPO_ANALYSIS.MD. Spawn concurrent tasks/sub-agents to research and author each of the following sections:

## 1. Repository Overview
- Provide a high-level summary of the project's purpose and functionality
- Identify the primary programming languages, frameworks, and technologies used
- List key dependencies and external services
- Describe the project's domain and target users

## 2. Project Structure Analysis
- Map out the directory structure and explain the organization pattern
- Identify configuration files and their purposes
- Highlight entry points and main executable files
- Note any build/deployment configurations

## 3. High-Level Architecture Diagram
Create a Mermaid diagram showing:
- Major system components and layers (presentation, business logic, data, etc.)
- External dependencies and integrations
- Data flow between components
- Key architectural patterns used (MVC, microservices, event-driven, etc.)

## 4. Module/Component Analysis
For each major module or component:
- Explain its core responsibility and purpose
- List its public interfaces/APIs
- Identify its dependencies (both internal and external)
- Note any design patterns implemented

## 5. Interface/Abstraction Hierarchy
Create Mermaid class diagrams for core abstractions showing:
- Important classes and interfaces
- Key associations and dependencies
- Critical methods and properties

## 6. Data Flow and Sequence Diagrams
Create Mermaid sequence diagrams for the most important user flows or system processes:
- User authentication flow
- Main business operations
- Critical system interactions
- Error handling flows

## 7. Module Interaction Map
Create a Mermaid diagram showing:
- How different modules communicate
- API boundaries between modules
- Event flows or message passing
- Shared resources or data stores

## 10. Key Algorithms and Business Logic
Identify and explain:
- Core algorithms or complex logic
- Business rules implementation
- Performance-critical sections
- Notable design decisions

- Potential architectural improvements

For all diagrams, use GitHub compatible Mermaid syntax and ensure they are clear, properly labeled, and include legends where necessary. Use a dark theme consisting of black, gray, and whites. Provide context and explanations for each diagram to help readers understand the visualizations.

Please organize the output in a clear, hierarchical structure with appropriate markdown formatting. Use code blocks for file examples and ensure all technical terms are explained for readers who may be new to the codebase.
